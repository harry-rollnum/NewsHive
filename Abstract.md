## ✅ **Simplified Abstract (Layman + Academic Friendly)**

### **Abstract—**

In today’s digital world, fake news spreads faster than ever—often causing confusion, panic, and division. Social media platforms allow users to vote or like posts, but these systems are often misused. Biased users or fake accounts can boost false information, making it hard to trust what’s real.

This project introduces a **Crowd-Verified News and Trust-Based Voting System**, which uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to help people identify trustworthy news. The system checks each piece of news using smart techniques like **language analysis** and **sentiment detection** to judge if it seems real or suspicious.

Unlike regular voting systems, we don’t treat every vote the same. Instead, the system gives each user a **“credibility score”** based on how trustworthy they have been in the past. Users who consistently share helpful, accurate content get more voting power, while those who spread false or biased info get less influence.

There’s also a feature where nearby users can help verify urgent alerts or updates—like natural disasters or emergencies—making the system helpful in real-life situations too.

This system helps build a healthier digital space where truth matters more than popularity, and people are encouraged to share responsibly.

### 🧠 **What Problem Are We Solving?**  
Fake news is everywhere—online, on social media, and even in chat groups. People often vote or like posts without knowing if they’re true, and this spreads misinformation. Bad actors can abuse the system to make lies look real.

### 💡 **What’s Our Solution?**  
We built a system that:
- **Checks the content of news using AI** (Is it suspicious? Is the tone aggressive or emotional?).

- **Adjusts the power of each vote**—trusted users have more say.
- **Flags users** who constantly spread biased or fake info.
- Lets people in the **local area verify emergency alerts** to prevent panic.
